# B2B Credit SaaS - Customer Deployment Checklist

## Overview

This checklist will guide you through deploying the B2B Credit SaaS platform to production. The application is ready to deploy and all build issues have been resolved.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [ ] A server or hosting platform (Coolify, AWS, Vercel, or similar)
- [ ] A PostgreSQL database (version 12 or higher)
- [ ] A domain name (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Node.js 18.x or higher (if self-hosting)
- [ ] Docker installed (if using Docker deployment)

---

## üîß Step 1: Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with these **REQUIRED** variables:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:5432/database_name"
DIRECT_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:5432/database_name"

# NextAuth Configuration (CRITICAL - Generate a new secret!)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="<YOUR_GENERATED_SECRET_HERE>"
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://yourdomain.com"

# Application URLs
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://yourdomain.com"

# Environment
NODE_ENV="production"
```

### Generate Security Secrets

**IMPORTANT**: Generate a secure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

Copy the output and use it as your `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` value.

### Optional Environment Variables

```bash
# Email (if using Resend for transactional emails)
RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Analytics (Rybbit - already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_RYBBIT_SITE_ID="a56da861ea4f"
NEXT_PUBLIC_RYBBIT_HOST="https://app.rybbit.io"

# Error Tracking (if using Sentry)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN="https://xxxxx@xxxxx.ingest.sentry.io/xxxxx"
```

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Step 2: Database Setup

### Create PostgreSQL Database

1. Create a new PostgreSQL database
2. Note the connection details (host, port, username, password, database name)
3. Update `DATABASE_URL` and `DIRECT_URL` in your `.env` file

### Initialize Database Schema

Run Prisma migrations to create all tables:

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

This will create all necessary tables:
- Users
- Applications
- Leads
- Documents
- Blog posts
- Categories
- Newsletter subscribers
- Onboarding profiles
- Email drips

---

## üöÄ Step 3: Choose Your Deployment Method

### Option A: Coolify (Recommended for Simplicity)

See `COOLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions.

**Quick Steps:**
1. Create new application in Coolify
2. Connect your Git repository
3. Set Build Pack to "Docker"
4. Add environment variables from Step 1
5. Create PostgreSQL database in Coolify
6. Deploy!

### Option B: AWS (Recommended for Scale)

See `AWS_DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md` for complete instructions.

**Quick Steps:**
1. Push Docker image to ECR: `./scripts/aws/deploy-to-ecr.sh production`
2. Set up secrets: `./scripts/aws/setup-secrets.sh`
3. Deploy to ECS: `./scripts/aws/quick-deploy.sh production`

### Option C: Docker Compose (Self-Hosted)

**Quick Steps:**

1. Update `.env.docker` with your production values
2. Build and start containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
3. Check logs:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

### Option D: Vercel/Netlify

1. Connect your Git repository
2. Add environment variables in platform dashboard
3. Set up PostgreSQL database (e.g., Supabase, Neon, Railway)
4. Deploy from main branch

---

## üë§ Step 4: Create Admin User

After deployment, you need an admin user to access the admin panel.

### Method 1: Using Admin Setup Script (Recommended)

```bash
npm run admin:setup
```

This creates an admin user:
- Email: `admin@b2bcredit.com`
- Password: `Admin123!`

**Custom admin credentials:**
```bash
ADMIN_EMAIL="your@email.com" ADMIN_PASSWORD="YourSecurePassword" npm run admin:setup
```

### Method 2: Using Prisma Studio (Manual)

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

1. Navigate to the Users table
2. Find your user
3. Change `role` from `CLIENT` to `ADMIN`
4. Save changes

### Method 3: Via Database Query

```sql
UPDATE "User" SET role = 'ADMIN' WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

---

## ‚úîÔ∏è Step 5: Verify Deployment

### Health Checks

Test these endpoints to verify the application is running:

- [ ] Homepage: `https://yourdomain.com`
- [ ] API Health: `https://yourdomain.com/api/health`
- [ ] API Docs: `https://yourdomain.com/api-docs`
- [ ] Login Page: `https://yourdomain.com/login`
- [ ] Register Page: `https://yourdomain.com/register`

### Test User Flow

- [ ] Register a new user at `/register`
- [ ] Login with the new user at `/login`
- [ ] Access dashboard at `/dashboard`
- [ ] Fill out application form at `/application`
- [ ] Submit application

### Test Admin Flow

- [ ] Login as admin at `/login`
- [ ] Access admin panel at `/admin`
- [ ] View applications in admin panel
- [ ] View leads in admin panel
- [ ] Create a blog post at `/admin/blog/create`

### Check Database Migrations

```bash
npx prisma migrate status
```

All migrations should show as applied.

---

## üîí Step 6: Security Configuration

### SSL/TLS Certificate

- [ ] Ensure SSL/TLS is enabled (Let's Encrypt via Coolify/AWS ALB)
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is working
- [ ] Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to use `https://`

### Environment Variables Security

- [ ] Verify `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is unique and secure (minimum 32 characters)
- [ ] Ensure `.env` is NOT committed to Git
- [ ] Use platform secrets manager (AWS Secrets Manager, Coolify secrets, etc.)

### Database Security

- [ ] Database is not publicly accessible
- [ ] Strong database password is set
- [ ] Database backups are configured

---

## üìß Step 7: Email Configuration (Optional)

If you want to send emails (password reset, onboarding, notifications):

1. Sign up for Resend: https://resend.com
2. Get API key
3. Add to environment variables:
   ```bash
   RESEND_API_KEY="re_xxxxxxxxxxxx"
   ```
4. Verify email sending at `/api/onboarding/drip`

---

## üìä Step 8: Analytics Setup (Optional)

### Rybbit Analytics (Already Configured)

The application already has Rybbit analytics integration:
- Site ID: `a56da861ea4f`
- Dashboard: https://app.rybbit.io

To use your own Rybbit account:
1. Sign up at https://rybbit.io
2. Create a new site
3. Update environment variable:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_RYBBIT_SITE_ID="your_site_id"
   ```

### Error Tracking with Sentry (Optional)

1. Sign up for Sentry: https://sentry.io
2. Create a new project
3. Get your DSN
4. Add to environment variables:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN="https://xxxxx@xxxxx.ingest.sentry.io/xxxxx"
   ```

---

## üì± Step 9: Domain Configuration

### DNS Setup

Point your domain to your deployment:

**For Coolify:**
1. In Coolify, go to your application ‚Üí Domains
2. Add your domain
3. Update DNS A record to point to your Coolify server IP
4. Enable SSL/TLS in Coolify

**For AWS:**
1. Create Route 53 hosted zone
2. Point domain to ALB
3. ACM certificate will auto-provision

**For Vercel:**
1. Add domain in Vercel dashboard
2. Update DNS records as instructed
3. SSL is automatic

### Update Environment Variables

After domain is configured:
```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
```

Redeploy after changing these values.

## üîÑ Step 10: Ongoing Maintenance

### Database Backups

- [ ] Set up automated daily backups
- [ ] Test backup restoration process
- [ ] Store backups securely offsite

### Monitoring

- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom, etc.)
- [ ] Monitor application logs
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Set up alerts for errors

### Updates

When updating the application:

```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run database migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Rebuild and deploy
npm run build
```
